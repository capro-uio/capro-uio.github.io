  Approval to become a core facility at UiO will make it easier for researchers to use Capro's services.
---

Right before the summer we were approved as a core facility at UiO. 
This means that we are now a part of the core facility network at UiO, and that we can offer our services to researchers at UiO and other institutions.
We have already been approached by several regarding our services, and we are looking forward to working with them in the future.

We are firstly working on getting our services up and running, and in parallell are working on the administrative side of things.
We hope to get everything running smoothly by the end of the year, and to have tested our services on a few minor projects by then.
Stay tuned for more updates!
