I've witnessed Mo's masterful revamping of the R-Ladies website.
She's put a lot of care in creating a professional and beautiful interface, 
but also in creating sustainable update workflows for humans and machines.
Her web development skills increase faster than Hugo version numbers,
she's very resilient to any 502 thrown at her, 
and she's a kind and thoughtful collaborator.
200/10 would recommend working with her!
