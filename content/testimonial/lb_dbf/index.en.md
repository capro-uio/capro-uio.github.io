The University of Barcelona and partners had successful access to the Lifebrain Consortium data thanks to the Capro team’s effective coordination.
Capro organized data in an easy-to-navigate system and provided guidance and updates to ensure high standards.
The data included demographics, cognition, lifestyles, and MRI.
